Regular monitoring of logs and proactive debugging will also help in identifying and resolving issues efficiently.",        "refusal": null,        "annotations": []      },      "logprobs": null,      "finish_reason": "stop"    }  ],  "usage": {    "prompt_tokens": 2502,    "completion_tokens": 561,    "total_tokens": 3063,    "prompt_tokens_details": {      "cached_tokens": 0,      "audio_tokens": 0    },    "completion_tokens_details": {      "reasoning_tokens": 0,      "audio_tokens": 0,      "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0,      "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0    }  },  "service_tier": "default",  "system_fingerprint": null}
