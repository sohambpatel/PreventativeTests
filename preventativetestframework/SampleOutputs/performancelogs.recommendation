This could indicate an issue with authentication or authorization for these requests, leading to delays or errors.\n\n2. **Image Requests**: There are multiple requests for image resources (URLs start with `data:image/png;base64`). Loading these images directly via base64 encoding could affect the page load times, especially if these images are large in size.\n\n3. **Static Resources**: Requests for static resources like `.svg` and `.jpg` files are present. Loading these resources can contribute to the overall loading time of a page, especially if there are multiple resources being fetched.\n\n4. **Response Codes**: The majority of the responses are returning a `200 OK` status code, which is good. However, it's essential to investigate further the requests that are returning errors (401 or others) to address potential issues.\n\n5. **Empty Response Times**: Some response times are marked as `Optional.empty`. It would be beneficial to capture and analyze the response times for these requests to assess the performance impact.\n\nTo improve the performance of your website, you may consider the following actions:\n- Investigate and resolve the `401 Unauthorized` responses for requests to `events.backtrace.io`.\n- Optimize the loading of images, especially those loaded via base64 encoding, by considering alternative loading methods.\n- Ensure that static resources are optimized for faster loading times.\n- Monitor and analyze response times for requests with empty response time values to address any underlying issues.\n\nBy addressing these points, you can potentially enhance the performance of your website and improve the overall user experience.",        "refusal": null,        "annotations": []      },      "logprobs": null,      "finish_reason": "stop"    }  ],  "usage": {    "prompt_tokens": 12489,    "completion_tokens": 356,    "total_tokens": 12845,    "prompt_tokens_details": {      "cached_tokens": 0,      "audio_tokens": 0    },    "completion_tokens_details": {      "reasoning_tokens": 0,      "audio_tokens": 0,      "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0,      "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0    }  },  "service_tier": "default",  "system_fingerprint": null}
