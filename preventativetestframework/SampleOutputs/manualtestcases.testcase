It looks like you're encountering a `TypeError` related to reading properties of an undefined object. This often indicates that the code is trying to access a property on an object that hasn't been properly initialized or is missing.\n\nTo create effective test cases in Gherkin format, we need to focus on the user interactions that might lead to this error. Specifically, we should ensure that the UI elements are present and that the user actions are handled correctly.\n\nHere’s a suggestion for Gherkin-style test cases based on the provided error log:\n\n```gherkin\nFeature: Checkout Step One\n\n  Scenario: User interacts with the input field\n    Given the user is on the Checkout Step One page\n    When the user enters a value in the input field\n    Then the input field should accept the value\n    And the corresponding value should be updated in the state\n\n  Scenario: User submits the form without filling required fields\n    Given the user is on the Checkout Step One page\n    When the user clicks on the submit button without entering required information\n    Then an error message should be displayed indicating that all fields are required\n    And the form should not proceed to the next step\n\n  Scenario: User clears the input field\n    Given the user is on the Checkout Step One page\n    When the user enters a value in the input field\n    And the user clears the input field\n    Then the input field should be empty\n    And the corresponding value in the state should be undefined\n\n  Scenario: User interacts with an undefined input field\n    Given the user is on the Checkout Step One page\n    When the user tries to interact with an input field that is not rendered\n    Then the application should not throw an error\n    And the user should see a friendly message indicating the input is not available\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **User Interactions**: Each scenario focuses on a specific user interaction that could lead to the `TypeError`.\n2. **UI Elements**: The scenarios check for the presence and behavior of UI elements like input fields and buttons.\n3. **Error Handling**: The scenarios also include checks for proper error handling when users perform unexpected actions.\n\nFeel free to adjust the scenarios based on your application's specific behavior and requirements! If you have more details about the user interactions or the UI elements involved, I’d be happy to refine these test cases further.",        "refusal": null,        "annotations": []      },      "logprobs": null,      "finish_reason": "stop"    }  ],  "usage": {    "prompt_tokens": 260,    "completion_tokens": 491,    "total_tokens": 751,    "prompt_tokens_details": {      "cached_tokens": 0,      "audio_tokens": 0    },    "completion_tokens_details": {      "reasoning_tokens": 0,      "audio_tokens": 0,      "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0,      "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0    }  },  "service_tier": "default",  "system_fingerprint": "fp_51db84afab"}
